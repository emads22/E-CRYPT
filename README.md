# E-CRYPT ⚿

### Overview:
E-CRYPT is a user-friendly GUI application designed for encrypting and decrypting messages using Morse Code and Binary Code encoding methods. Whether securing sensitive communications or exploring historical encoding techniques, E-CRYPT offers versatile functionality for modern encryption needs.

Users can input any text message and select between Morse Code or Binary Code encryption methods. The application seamlessly decrypts messages encoded in these formats, displaying results on-screen and automatically copying them to the clipboard for easy integration into documents and messages.

This application was developed as part of my [**CS50X**](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/) **`Final Project`** in 2022. You can explore its development on [me/50](https://github.com/me50/emads22/tree/cs50/problems/2022/x/project) repository.

**Features:**
- **Encryption and Decryption:** Supports both Morse Code and Binary Code methods.
- **Clipboard Integration:** Automatically copies encrypted or decrypted messages for convenient pasting.
- **Morse Code Playback:** Allows users to hear encrypted Morse Code messages as distinctive Beep sounds at 800 Hz.
- **Text-to-Speech:** Enables listening to decrypted text messages using built-in text-to-speech functionality.

## ◼ Foreword about Morse Code and Binary Code: 

### ▪ "Morse Code":
Invented by Samuel Morse in 1836, Morse Code remains a timeless method for transmitting text messages using sequences of short (dots) and long (dashes) sounds. Each letter and numeral is represented by a unique combination of these elements.

E-CRYPT utilizes the International Morse Code standard, encompassing uppercase letters A-Z and digits 0-9. Users have the option to audibly experience Morse Code messages as distinct Beep sounds, adding a dynamic element to encryption practices.

Morse Code's adaptability spans across various communication mediums, including sound, light signals, and more, ensuring its relevance in modern telecommunication and military applications.

When composing messages in Morse Code, letters are separated by spaces and words by slashes (/).

### ▪ "Binary Code":
Binary Code serves as the backbone of computing and telecommunications, translating characters into sequences of '0's and '1's known as binary digits or bits. Each character, including special symbols, numerals, and both uppercase and lowercase letters, is represented by a specific binary pattern.

E-CRYPT employs a fixed-width Binary Code encoding method, ensuring clarity and precision during message decryption. This approach underpins essential data encoding tasks, facilitating efficient data transmission and processing in digital environments.

When using Binary Code, each letter is delineated by a space to maintain readability and facilitate accurate decoding.
